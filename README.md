# Transformer Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis  

This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model for sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. The goal is to adapt a general-purpose language model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.  

## Project Overview  

1. **Setup and Preprocessing**  
   - A pre-trained Transformer model (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT) is selected from Hugging Face's Model Hub.  
   - The IMDb dataset is used for binary sentiment classification.  
   - Text data is tokenized using the associated tokenizer.  
   - Labels are converted to numerical format, and the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.  

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**  
   - The pre-trained model is loaded and modified with a classification head.  
   - The model is fine-tuned using an appropriate loss function and the AdamW optimizer.  
   - Training is performed for multiple epochs with validation and checkpointing.  

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers are tested.  
   - Techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling are applied.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - The fine-tuned model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Its performance is compared with a baseline model.  

5. **Visualization and Reporting**  
   - Training and validation loss curves are plotted.  
   - Sample predictions are analyzed.  
   - Challenges and improvements in fine-tuning are discussed.  

This project demonstrates how fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer significantly improves performance on sentiment classification tasks. ðŸš€
